# LuaMe

Lua is fun and all, but I think it could be better. Below and behold: **LuaMe**!!

The alternative that translates into lua.

## Variables

In Lua:
```lua
    local MyLocalVariable = "Hello!";
    MyGlobalVariable = "Yo.";
```

In LuaMe:
```
    let MyLocalVariable = "Hello!";
    global MyGlobalVariable = "Yo.";
```
